## random notes taken

- higher-order functions are functions that take another function as an argument OR functions that return another function.
- i think i understand "Functions are first-class objects" a bit more: Functions can be treated like Strings or Numbers: they can store values. they can be passed to another function. they can have properties like regular objects.
